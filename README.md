sample_code README:

These scripts are a few brief demonstrations of the types of projects I have done, both at UW and personally.

aviso_ftp.sh:
This downloads a user selected year of satellite data from the aviso ftp site.

power_spec_demo.m (MATLAB)
Generates pseudo data with a few primary frequencies (plus noise) and calculates the power spectrum of the time series. Plots show the strongst frequencies and 95% confidence interval.

profile_CI_demo.m (MATLAB)
Generates pseudo data to demonstrate how I calculate the average respiration profile in my 2nd thesis chapter. Creates a plot to show the average profile + 95% CI, as well as a map to show where data come from.

python_cfb_2013.py (PYTHON)
Uses score differential during each college football game of 2013 to quantitatively rank 125 FBS (D1-A) teams. Essentially, little weight is placed on if a team won or not (a binary metric), and instead the focus is on how well a team performed against its competition. A team that lost a close game to the #1 team may rank better than a team that won by 10 points against the worst teams.
